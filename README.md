Welcome to the official repository for the Blockchain Arena project! This document serves as the central hub for our timeline, assignments, and resources.

## About The Project

Ready to jump into the Blockchain Arena? Ever wondered how Bitcoin really works and why people go crazy for crypto? Forget boring lectures ‚Äì in this project, you'll build your own blockchain world from scratch!

We start with how to make a currency digital with no central authority, then dive straight into coding. Using your Python/C++ skills, you'll create a network of computers (nodes) that talk to each other, build digital blocks, chain them together, and watch a cryptocurrency network come to life.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will:
- Understand the foundational principles of blockchain technology and P2P networks.
- Implement a functional blockchain simulator with transactions and Proof-of-Work consensus.
- Gain hands-on experience with object-oriented programming, data structures, and discrete-event simulation.
- Build and deploy a basic decentralized application (DApp) on an Ethereum test network.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Good programming skills in Python or C++ (Comfortable with Object-Oriented Programming and basic Data Structures & Algorithms).
* No prior blockchain knowledge is required!
* Loads of curiosity and enthusiasm to dive deep into crypto tech!

## üóìÔ∏è Project Timeline (8 Weeks)

### Weeks 1-2: Welcome to the Arena!
* **Learn:** Core blockchain concepts, what a P2P network is, and why decentralization matters. We'll set up our development environment using Git, Python/C++.
* **Assignment 1:** Build a basic P2P network structure where nodes can connect to each other.

### Weeks 3-4: Building the Chain
* **Learn:** Deep dive into the structure of blocks and transactions. We'll learn how information propagates through the network using a gossip protocol.
* **Assignment 2 (Part 1):** Simulate a P2P Cryptocurrency Network, allowing nodes to create and share blocks of transactions.

### Weeks 5-6: The Mining Race!
* **Learn:** The economics and mechanics of Proof-of-Work (PoW). We'll cover concepts like nonce, difficulty, and the *"longest chain wins"* rule for achieving consensus.
* **Assignment 2 (Part 2):** Simulate the PoW mining loop. Watch your nodes compete to solve cryptographic puzzles and add new blocks to the chain.

### Weeks 7-8: Create a Crypto Gem
* **Learn:** The basics of smart contracts using Solidity. We'll use the Remix IDE to build and deploy a simple DApp on an Ethereum test network (no real money needed!).
* **Assignment 4:** Create a simple mini-DApp (like an on-chain poll or voting system). You'll code a basic smart contract and connect it to a simple webpage.
